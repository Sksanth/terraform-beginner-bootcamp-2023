## Semantic Versioning

This project will use semantic versioning for tagging purposes by following the guidelines at [semver.org](https://semver.org/)

The general format:

 **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, eg. `1.0.1`
 
- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

## Project Workflow
- **Issue Creation:** Begin by creating new issues. Provide a clear title, add comments, assign labels, and submit the issue.
- **Branch Management:** Create a new branch, perform a git fetch, and switch to the branch in local repository.
- **Action on Open Issues:** Address open issues as required, making necessary changes or updates.
- **Commit with Caution:** Before committing changes, ensure there is no sensitive data included. Keep the commits clean and concise.
- **Commit and Sync:** Commit the changes and sync them with the relevant issue number and name (e.g., '#1 add semantic versioning documentation to project').
- **Pull Request Creation:** Create a pull request, squash and merge, and confirm.
- **Maintain Main Branch:** Switch back to the main branch, pull the latest changes, tag the work (e.g., 'git tag 0.1.0'), and push the tags (git push --tags).
- **Review Tag Changes:** Refresh the Git log/graph to view the updated tags and changes.
